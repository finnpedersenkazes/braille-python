1. #  **Getting Started** {#getting-started}

Welcome to your new Brailliant™ BI 20X Braille display. 

This user guide provides instructions for orientation, usage, navigation, and updating of the device. For more information please refer to the [Brailliant BI 20X product page](http://www.aph.org/product/chameleon-20) on the HumanWare website or call your nearest HumanWare supplier.

1. ## **In the Box** {#in-the-box}

The box contains the following items:

* Brailliant™ X Series braille display  
* USB-C to USB-A cable  
* USB to AC adapter  
* Nylon carrying case with lanyard  
* Print Getting Started guides

  2. ## **Orientation of Brailliant BI 20X** {#orientation-of-brailliant-bi-20x}

The Brailliant BI 20X has a 20-cell braille display, a Perkins-style keyboard, two Space bars, a Home button and four thumb keys for navigation. 

1. ### **Top Face** {#top-face}

The top face of the Brailliant can be divided into two sections: front and rear.

The front section of the top face consists of a refreshable braille display containing 20 braille cells and 20 cursor routing buttons. Each cursor routing button is associated with the braille cell directly below it. When editing text, pressing one of the cursor routing buttons moves the editing cursor to the associated braille cell. For any other instance, pressing any cursor button activates a selected item. 

When you are not editing text, any cursor button activates a selected item. 

The rear section of the top face includes a Perkins-style braille keyboard where each key represents a Dot on a braille cell. The keys under your left hand represent Dots 1, 2, 3, and Backspace, where Dot 1 is located under your index finger and Backspace under your little finger. The keys under your right hand represent Dots 4, 5, 6, and Enter, where Dot 4 is located under your index finger and Enter under your little finger.

2. ### **Front Edge** {#front-edge}

On the front edge of the Brailliant are five buttons. From left to right, the buttons are as follows:

* Previous thumb key  
* Left thumb key   
* Home button (circular shape) – used to return to the Main menu or exit Terminal mode  
* Right thumb key  
* Next thumb key

  3. ### **Left Edge** {#left-edge}

On the left edge, from front to back are the following:

* USB-A port   
* Power button – press and hold this button for 2 seconds to turn the device ON.   
* Green LED – visually indicates the status of the device  
* USB-C port – use the cable that came with your Brailliant to connect it to a power outlet or a PC.

  4. ### **Right Edge** {#right-edge}

On the right edge, from front to back are the following:

* Two volume buttons (Currently not active)

* 3.5mm Audio jack (Currently not active)

  5. ### **Rear Edge** {#rear-edge}

The rear edge only contains an SD card port located near the left edge of the device. This port allows you to insert SD cards for external storage.

6. ### **Bottom Side** {#bottom-side}

In each corner underneath your Brailliant are four anti-slip pads. 

In the middle, closer to the front edge is a slightly indented rectangle with a different texture. In this rectangle is a sticker containing printed hardware information about your Brailliant. Above the sticker, there is a braille label containing the serial number of your device.

Towards the back left of the device is the battery compartment. It is closed and secured with two Phillips-head screws. 

3. ## **Charging Brailliant BI 20X** {#charging-brailliant-bi-20x}

Prior to using your Brailliant, make sure it is charged completely. 

Connect the USB-C end of the recharge cable to the USB-C port located on the left edge of your Brailliant. Minimal effort is required and forcing the connection can damage the cable or the device. 

Connect the USB-A end of the recharge cable to the power adapter, then plug the power adapter into a power outlet. Use the provided power adapter for optimal recharge.

Alternatively, you can charge the device using your computer and the USB-A to USB-C recharge cable, but note that this method of charging is slower than charging with a power adapter.

4. ## **Powering On and Off** {#powering-on-and-off}

The Power button is on the left edge of the Brailliant. It is oval-shaped with a raised dot in the center. 

If your device is charged, press and hold the Power button for approximately 2 seconds to power on the Brailliant. There is a quick vibration and “starting” appears on the braille display along with a tactile loading animation that circles during start-up. 

A few moments after you boot your device for the first time, you will be welcomed with a language selection menu. Press Enter to open the list of languages, select one and press Enter to close the list. Close the dialog box once the changes are completed.

After a few seconds, the start-up is complete and “terminal” appears on the braille display. Your Brailliant is now ready for use. 

To power Off, press and hold the Power button for approximately 2 seconds. A confirmation message appears on the braille display. Select Ok by pressing the Previous or Next thumb key, then press Enter or a Cursor-routing key.

Alternatively, you can follow these steps to power Off the Brailliant:

1. Press P to reach the Power Off menu item.

2. Press Enter or a cursor routing key.

3. Select Ok by pressing the Previous or Next thumb key.

4. Press Enter or a cursor routing key.

   5. ## **Adjusting the Sleep Mode**  {#adjusting-the-sleep-mode}

To preserve the battery, Brailliant goes into Sleep mode after 5 minutes of inactivity. You can adjust the length of time in the Options. You can also manually put your device into Sleep mode by a short press of the power button. 

To wake up the device, press the Power button.

6. ## **About the About Menu** {#about-the-about-menu}

The About menu provides various information about your device, such as version numbers, model number, serial number, licenses, and copyright.

To open the About Menu:

1. Go to the Main menu.  
2. Select Options.  
3. Press Enter.   
4. Go to the About item.  
5. Press Enter. 

Alternatively, you can use the shortcut Space \+ I to open the About dialog. 

7. ## **Launching the Main Menu** {#launching-the-main-menu}

The KeySoft Main menu is your Brailliant’s default home menu. From the main menu, you can access all KeySoft Lite applications. When you start your Brailliant or close an application, you automatically return to this menu.

You can at any time return to the main menu by simply pressing the Home button on your Brailliant (the button shaped like a circle located on the front edge of your Brailliant, in the middle). Alternatively, you can use the Go to Main Menu command on the keyboard by pressing SPACE with DOTS 1 2 3 4 5 6\. 

2. #  **Navigating and Using Menus** {#navigating-and-using-menus}

KeySoft Lite is the heart of your Brailliant BI 20X, supporting all applications that are built in your braille display. KeySoft’s main menu can also be customized, which will allow you to hide and unhide applications from the Main menu. More information on customizing your Main Menu can be found in the [Customize KeySofts Main Menu section](#customize-keysoft’s-main-menu).

1. ## **Navigating the Main Menu** {#navigating-the-main-menu}

The Main menu contains the following items:

* Terminal  
* Editor: KeyPad  
* Victor Reader  
* File manager : keyFiles  
* Calculator : keyCalc  
* Date and time  
* Options  
* Online services  
* User guide  
* Power Off

Press the Previous or Next thumb keys to scroll through the list to the menu item of your choice. Then press Enter or a cursor routing key to access it.

You can return to the Main menu at any time by pressing the Home button or Space with all six Dots.

2. ## **Panning Text on the Braille Display** {#panning-text-on-the-braille-display}

Often times the text on the braille display is too long to fit on a single line. To read the entire sentence, scroll or “pan” the text ahead or back by pressing the Left and Right thumb keys on the Brailliant. The Left and Right thumb keys are the second and third buttons on the front edge of the device. 

3. ## **Using the Context Menu for Additional Functions** {#using-the-context-menu-for-additional-functions}

The Contextual Menu lists all available actions for the KeySoft application you are currently working in as well as their associated commands. It can be very useful when you forget how to do a specific command. 

To activate the Context Menu, press Space \+ M. A menu opens with a list of actions you can perform at that particular moment. Scroll through the menu to the desired action and press Enter or a cursor routing key. 

Press Space \+ E to exit the Context Menu.

4. ## **Navigating by First Letters of Words** {#navigating-by-first-letters-of-words}

Most of the time, you can jump to an item in a menu by typing the first letter of that item. Doing so automatically moves your focus to the first item in the list starting with that letter. Typing the same letter twice moves the focus to the second item in the list starting with that letter, and so on. 

For example, to reach the Options menu on the Brailliant, you type the letter ‘O’ on your keyboard.

Note that KeySoft apps found on your main menu are optimized for first letter navigation.

5. ## **Using Shortcuts/Key Combinations to Navigate** {#using-shortcuts/key-combinations-to-navigate}

As the name implies, shortcuts, also known as key combinations, make it easy to quickly navigate through a menu or file. 

The most commonly used shortcuts on the Brailliant BI 20X are indicated in Table 1\.

3. ## **Close a File** {#close-a-file}

To close a file that is opened in KeyPad, press Space \+ E. Alternatively, open the Context menu using Space \+ M, then scroll to and activate the File menu. Select Close file item.
